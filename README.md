 Ransomware Simulator for Cybersecurity Education

A safe, controlled, and configurable ransomware simulator designed to help students, cybersecurity analysts, and educators understand ransomware behavior and test endpoint security controls without any risk to real data.

⚠️ IMPORTANT: Safety & Ethical Considerations
🔴 THIS IS AN EDUCATIONAL TOOL, NOT MALWARE 🔴

This simulator is designed with fundamental safety mechanisms to prevent accidental damage:

✅ Operates ONLY on Decoy Files: Hardcoded to work exclusively within designated directories

✅ No Real Data Loss: Encryption is fully reversible using locally saved keys

✅ No Persistence or Spreading: Does not hide, create startup tasks, or propagate

✅ VM-Only Operation: Should only be run inside isolated Virtual Machines

✅ Clear Educational Intent: All outputs labeled as "SIMULATION ONLY"

🌟 Key Features
🔐 Realistic Encryption
Uses industry-standard AES-128 encryption via cryptography.fernet

Genuinely encrypts files to trigger EDR/SIEM detection systems

Unique key generation for each simulation run

⚙️ Configurable Scenarios
YAML-based configuration for easy customization

Modular architecture supporting future enhancements

Flexible target directory and parameter settings

📋 Professional Implementation
Comprehensive error handling and logging

Unit tests with pytest framework

Code quality assurance with ruff linter

GitHub Actions CI/CD pipeline

🎯 Educational Value
Safe testing of security controls and incident response

Hands-on learning without operational risk

Realistic attack simulation for training purposes

🚀 Quick Start
Prerequisites
Python 3.9 or higher

Virtual Machine (VirtualBox, VMware, or similar)

Git

Installation
Clone the Repository

bash
git clone https://github.com/kr3xxz/ransomware-simulator.git
cd ransomware-simulator
Set Up Virtual Environment

bash
# Linux/macOS
python3 -m venv venv
source venv/bin/activate

# Windows
python -m venv venv
venv\Scripts\activate
Install Dependencies

bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
📖 Usage Guide
Complete Simulation Workflow
Step 1: Plant Decoy Files 🌱
bash
python simulator.py --plant
Creates fresh decoy files in the working directory

Step 2: Run Encryption Simulation 🔒
bash
python simulator.py --encrypt
Output example:

text
🔒 Starting encryption simulation...
✅ Encryption complete. Key saved as: 1691523456.key
📋 Copy the key filename for decryption!

Step 3: Verify Encryption 🔍
bash
file decoys/*  # or decoys/* depending on config
Should show files as "ASCII text" (encrypted)

Step 4: Decrypt and Restore 🔑
bash
python simulator.py --decrypt 1691523456.key
Step 5: Verify Restoration ✅
bash
file decoys/*
Should show original file types restored

Additional Commands
View logs: cat logs/latest.json
